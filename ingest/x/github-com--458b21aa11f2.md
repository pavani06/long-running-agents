AutoSaddler automatically improves LLM-agent harnesses by diagnosing execution traces, applying structured updates to prompts, tools, and middleware, and selecting changes that generalize.
📄 Paper · 🌐 Project website · 🎥 Short video
Preliminary results report the following test Pass@1 scores across benchmarks and agent harnesses:
| Benchmark | Base agent harness | Base Pass@1 | AutoSaddler Pass@1 | Improvement | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GAIA2 | Default ReAct agent | 53.0 | 62.0 | +9.0 pp | 
| SWE-Bench Pro | SWE-agent | 37.3 | 46.9 | +9.6 pp | 
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | Terminus 2 | 40.0 | 50.0 | +10.0 pp | 
See the paper and interactive project website for per-model results, ablations, compute-efficiency plots, and optimization trajectories.
- Full-harness optimization: searches over prompts, tool definitions and implementations, middleware hooks, and agent-loop logic.
- In-depth diagnosis: deeply debugs execution traces and the harness codebase to identify root causes rather than relying on shallow reflection.
- Structured intervention: targets prompts, tools, and middleware through an explicit patch taxonomy and phased Capability-to-Steering schedule instead of unconstrained editing.
- Generalization-aware selection: validates updates beyond the motivating trajectories and uses reflection with an evolution DAG (EvoDAG) to retain broadly useful lessons.
- Durable execution: records append-only events, immutable provenance, resumable state, and content-addressed candidates.
- 2026-08-25: Added V2 support for optimizing the Meta-ARE harness on GAIA2.
- 2026-08-24: The AutoSaddler paper was released as arXiv v1, together with the project website and short video.
AutoSaddler requires Python 3.12-3.14, uv, and Git.
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/AutoSaddler.git
cd AutoSaddler
uv sync --extra dev
Run Python commands in this repository through uv run.
Run the deterministic, credential-free V2 template to exercise the optimization engine, event store, candidate evolution, and output projections:
uv run python -m autosaddler.v2.cli \
  --config configs/v2/local_template.yaml \
  --run-id local-template
Repeating the command resumes the same run after validating its resolved inputs.
- V2 (current): the durable, plugin-based implementation documented in this README. New users and integrations should start here.
- V1 (legacy): the research-quality implementation used for the experiments in the arXiv paper, retained for paper reproduction and reference. See the V1 README.

Start with the V2 architecture guide for the current implementation.
AutoSaddler formulates harness optimization as offline mini-batch learning. It uses three session types across the optimization lifecycle:
- Diagnosis-Patch: inspects failed traces and the harness codebase, then proposes structured Capability patches (code or infrastructure) and Steering patches (textual behavior changes).
- Reflection: compares pre- and post-patch traces, classifies fixed, regressed, still-failing, and still-passing cases, and records reusable lessons.
- Evolution: consults the full EvoDAG to synthesize candidates from successful components and lessons across lineages.
Candidate updates are verified on sampled training cases and gated on the development split. When its rollout budget is exhausted, AutoSaddler returns the highest-ranked development candidate. See the V2 architecture guide for the event lifecycle and invariants.
The current repository includes:
| Harness | Harness space | Benchmark | Purpose | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Deterministic fake harness ( fake ) | Structured component map | Synthetic cases | Local development and tests | 
| Meta-ARE Default ReAct Agent ( meta_are ) | Git repository | GAIA2 | End-to-end smoke experiments | 
V2 supports immutable, content-addressed component-map and Git candidate spaces. Optimizer sessions can use the built-in fake provider, Anthropic Claude Agent SDK, GitHub Copilot SDK, or Codex CLI transport.
Warning
The Codex provider relies on CLI-based execution and therefore introduces subprocess usage. See the Codex provider guide.
Integrations for additional harnesses (e.g., OpenClaw and Codex) and benchmarks (e.g., Terminal-Bench) are coming. Stay tuned!
Every V2 config starts with schema_version: autosaddler/v2.
A scenario plugin is the adapter between AutoSaddler's generic optimization engine and a
specific harness/benchmark pair. It supplies the harness space, cases, evaluator, evidence,
prompts, capabilities, and reproducibility metadata. A config selects that plugin and declares four
explicit ownership areas:
| Section | Responsibility | 
|---|---|
| scenario | Plugin type, immutable sources, datasets, evaluator, and mutable harness surface | 
| optimization | Task selection, acceptance, development gate, ranking, budget, retries, and timeouts | 
| provider | Optimizer provider, capabilities, model, endpoint, and provider-specific settings | 
| storage | Durable run root | 
Included configurations:
| Path | Purpose | 
|---|---|
| configs/v2/local_template.yaml | Credential-free deterministic V2 template | 
| configs/v2/codex_local_smoke.yaml | Real Codex optimizer with the deterministic local evaluator | 
| configs/v2/meta_are_smoke.yaml | Current Meta-ARE/GAIA2 smoke integration | 
| configs/v1/meta_are.yaml | Legacy full Meta-ARE/GAIA2 run | 
| configs/v1/meta_are_smoke.yaml | Legacy bounded smoke run | 
| configs/datasets/GAIA2/ | Shared train, development, and test split manifests | 
Configuration is strict and fail-closed. A run ID can be reused only when all resolved inputs are byte-identical; changed source revisions, manifests, settings, or provenance are rejected.
The checked-in V2 smoke config exercises the real optimization pipeline on seven GAIA2 scenarios: six training cases and one development case, for two optimization iterations. It is a bounded integration run rather than the full paper experiment, may take several hours, and incurs provider charges.
Use this sibling layout:
<parent>/
|-- AutoSaddler/
|-- Meta-ARE/
|-- meta_are_data/
`-- working_dir/
Clone the adapted Meta-ARE repository at the revision pinned by the config:
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/pshlego/Meta-ARE.git Meta-ARE
git -C Meta-ARE checkout --detach 395d1dd512add1e3aeb5a6a092490768b51e3ce5
mkdir -p working_dir
cd AutoSaddler
uv sync --extra meta-are-setup
Provision the seven manifest-selected GAIA2 payloads from the pinned Hugging Face revision.
HF_TOKEN is optional for this public dataset but avoids anonymous rate limits:
uv run --extra meta-are-setup python scripts/meta_are/provision_gaia2_scenarios.py \
  --destination-root "$PWD/../Meta-ARE/datasets_local/gaia2_smoke" \
  --revision 78ea3bdbdeec2bdcd6afa5420915d8a22f23ed99
The command must report "file_count": 7. Then provision the approximately 260 MB demo
filesystem:
uv run --extra meta-are-setup python scripts/meta_are/provision_demo_filesystem.py \
  --destination-root "$PWD/../meta_are_data/gaia2_filesystem" \
  --revision 132e26376f5e963bb59f64bcccdd02188cb08dee \
  --meta-are-project ../Meta-ARE
Both commands are idempotent, record source revisions and content digests, and reject mismatched local files. Evaluation runs with Hugging Face clients forced offline.
The smoke config uses OpenAI gpt-4.1-mini for the task agent and judge, and Anthropic
claude-opus-4-6 for optimization:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
Run from the external working directory so generated workspaces cannot inherit repository-level agent instructions through Git ancestry. Use a new run ID for every independent run:
cd ../working_dir
RUN_ID="meta-are-smoke-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
printf 'run_id=%s\n' "$RUN_ID"
uv run --project ../AutoSaddler \
  python -m autosaddler.v2.cli \
  --config ../AutoSaddler/configs/v2/meta_are_smoke.yaml \
  --run-id "$RUN_ID"
Runs are written under working_dir/outputs/v2_meta_are/runs/<run-id>/. Success writes
result.json with "iterations": 2 and prints the selected candidate and development score.
A run is self-contained and can include:
<run-root>/<run-id>/
├── events.jsonl
├── manifest.json
├── snapshot.json
├── evolution_dag.json
├── metrics.jsonl
├── metrics-summary.json
├── result.json
├── resolved/
├── candidates/
├── evaluations/
├── sessions/
├── mutation-deltas/  # Git harnesses only
└── workspaces/
events.jsonl is authoritative. To resume after an interruption, confirm no process is using the
run ID and repeat the same command with the same inputs. Never run two processes against one run ID.
Review sessions/ and evaluations/ before sharing a run because traces may contain prompts,
responses, tool arguments, working directories, repository metadata, or other sensitive data.
To branch a validated nonterminal checkpoint into a new run:
uv run python -m autosaddler.v2.cli \
  --config CONFIG.yaml \
  --run-id NEW_RUN_ID \
  --fork-from-run-id SOURCE_RUN_ID \
  --fork-through-sequence LAST_EVENT_SEQUENCE
Only optimization.budget.max_iterations may differ when initializing a fork. Legacy checkpoints
cannot be imported.
A V2 scenario plugin owns the integration boundary: harness space, evaluator, evidence builder, prompt pack, disjoint train and development cases, provider capabilities, and resolved provenance.
Built-in integrations live under src/autosaddler/v2/plugins/. An external package can register a
plugin through the autosaddler.scenarios entry-point group without adding scenario-specific code
to this repository. AutoSaddler rejects duplicate names, API-version mismatches, malformed
descriptors, and plugin load failures.
Follow the scenario integration guide for the ownership checklist,
package layout, registration contract, tests, and smoke-config requirements. Use
src/autosaddler/v2/plugins/fake.py as the smallest deterministic example and
src/autosaddler/v2/plugins/meta_are/ as a production Git-harness example.
You are encouraged to use a coding agent to conduct the scenario integration by following the
integration guide.
